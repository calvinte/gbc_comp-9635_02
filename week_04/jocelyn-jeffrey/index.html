		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>Mykonos Restaurant, located just one block north of Davenport on Yonge Street, serves traditional Greek and Mediterranean cuisine, perfect a business lunch or casual dinner. Specialties include Santorini chicken, lamb shank , grilled Atlantic salmon and salads. The extensive menu also includes less traditional items, like pizza and pasta.</p>
		<p>It may not bring to mind windmills or cool sea breezes but the menu will transport you in an air reminiscent of the lovely Greek island for which it is named. </p>
